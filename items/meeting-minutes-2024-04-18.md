## Meeting Minutes
- Resolved the issue encountered by team members with running the project due to an incompatible version (AGP 8.3.0). The solution was to update Android Studio.

- Chuang Ma introduced his proposed theme to us. After discussion, it was unanimously approved, and we decided on the theme for the app we will develop: ShareBooks. Our theme is related to quality education, one of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which aims to ensure inclusive and equitable quality education for all. The ShareBooks app allows users to upload information about physical books they are willing to share. Other users can choose to borrow books they need or want to read and communicate with the sharer about the borrowing date and the location for picking up/returning the book. After completing the borrowing process, the app will record each user's borrowing history. A practical scenario is that a university graduate can share textbooks and recorded study notes he purchased during his course studies on the app, and an incoming freshman who is about to take the same course can see the textbook information shared and communicate with the graduate to arrange a location and date for borrowing. ShareBooks aims to address the challenge of inequitable access to educational resources faced by quality education. It fully utilizes everyone's idle books, allowing more people to access books for free and thereby gain more learning opportunities.

- We initially decided on the following features to implement: Search-Filter, Data-Profile, P2P-DM, P2P-Block, Privacy-Request, with potential features(not sure) including Interact-Share, FB-Persist, UI-Layout, Search-Invalid.

- The tasks assigned for next week are as follows:
