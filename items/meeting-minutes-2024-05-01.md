## Meeting Minutes
- I displayed the latest version of the app on a shared screen. Now we have implemented all the basic functions, along with some custom features, such as [Data-Formats] [Data-Graphical] [Search-Invalid] [Search-Filter] [Interact-Share]. At the same time, we have added some statistical charts to the app, making it easier for users to have a visual experience of the dataset.

- We tested all the features above and found some optimization space for some of it. The graphical feature can be more pluralistic with more tables and charts. The search algorithm should be better.

- We decided to make some adjustment for the page scrolling function. To be specific, we will delete the button format and keep the manual scrolling for it is main format nowadays.

- We discussed the Surprise assignment and allocate three members to find 3 code smells and the other two members will fix them.

- The tasks assigned for next week are as follows:
